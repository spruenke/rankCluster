# rankCluster
rankCluster package for non-parametric methods on clustered data
Provides functions for:
* Relative effects
* Variance-Covariance-Estimation
* Wald-type Test
* ANOVA-type Test
* max-t test
The functions are independent of weights. If the user does not provide weights, the functions default to unweighted estimators (i.e. pseudo-ranks).
